# Preprocessing-and-Classification-on-Lending-Club-dataset
Lending Club is a lending platform that lends money to people in need at an interest rate based on their credit history and other factors. In this blog, we will analyze this data and pre-process it based on our need and build a machine learning model that can identify a potential defaulter based on his/her history of transactions with Lending Club. 
This dataset contains 42538 rows and 144 columns. Out of these 144 columns, many columns have null values in majority.

The purpose of this project is:

1-Learning the basics of Exploratory Data Analysis using Python with Numpy, Matplotlib, and Pandas 

2-Classification using Machine Learning Models and improving model performance by using hyparameters techniques
